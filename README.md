# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 45
**Nintendo Switch Sales**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 45 brings [a viz](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/number.html) showing hardware and software sales for the Nintendo switch platform in various regions, and for various years during the month of March.

## Data Source
Data is fron Nintendo Investor Relations website [here](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/number.html)

## My Approach for Week 44
I took a playful, creative approach to the design of this viz.  Immediately after seeing the dataset, I wanted my dashboard arrayed like an old-school Nintendo controller, with the ability for users to click buttons and interact with the viz using the that old, loved controller.  I hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I enjoyed making it.
